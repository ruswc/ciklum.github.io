1. To start with to-do list, click "Create".
2. Not all fields are required, but the more information you provide, the easier it will be for you to work with your list in the future.
3. To save the note, click the "Save" button. To close the dialog without saving changes, click "Cancel".
4. By default, all notes are displayed on the page.
The note information is stored in the browser, so when you reload the page the to-do list does not disappear.
5. At the bottom right of each note is a menu button that contains the following items:
  - done
  - edit
  - delete
  
"Done" changes the look of the note - changes the background color to gray and adds a checkbox in the upper right corner, removing which you can cancel the status of "done" and the status of the note will again "open".

"Edit" opens a dialog where you can make changes to the note.

"Delete" deletes the note.

6. Search in to-do list.
The search is performed dynamically as you enter the title, change status and priority using the text box and the two drop-down lists on the top of the page.
To reset the filter data, reload the page.
